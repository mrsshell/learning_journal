#LJ-code201-Day8.md
Today we had a very long lecture covering user input and blogs. I loved the examples and was fascinated by the html, JavaScript and the CSS how they worked together. It was a lot of information to take in after doing a mind blowing code review.
Today I successfully built my store object constructor, built the stores, and had everything show up on in the table.
the creation of the document and id showing the location and text input for the various portions of the table were the most complicated. I really was not clear on how to go about getting my JavaScript to show up in html. i know that the table "longhand" html was not going to do at all. Ariel spent a lot of time with me helping me construct the document ids and amending their children, I should have committed more often and put the notes in the messages. i built a cell and then tried the one size fits all approach, and found that they really do have to be specifically arranged to show up in the right order. i was not sure of the order an probably wasted too much time tiring to research. This was covered in the lecture- but reading the code notes afterwards, it made no sense to me.
make the thing
put the thing somewhere
call the thing something
tell it what it is going to be
tell it what it is going to have in it
and then rename it for the new thing it's going to do
and then tell it what it's child is
