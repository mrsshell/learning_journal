#LJ-code201-day18
Today was better- I really learned more about css and how to position things in relation to the window.
I am also becoming very familiar with the git commands. I am able to work through my terminal and know where everything is and where I am pushing to.
I am still doing a lot of research as I go with the styling of the pages. I am really happy for the experience. Unfortunately I thought I lost a bunch of work- and it turned out to be some extra curly brackets ... ugh! debug!
Looking forwards to tomorrow!
