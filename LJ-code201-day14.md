#LJ-code201-day14.md
This morning I started out at 5:00 am going over the bus-mall code, and reviewing the video again.
I would like to get better at testing my code, piece by piece, but it's hard to take something that is dependent on another piece, to break it out and see if it's true or false.
Shannon really helped me test and fix the broken pieces, and now I don't feel nearly as stressed. there's nothing like being on the verge of thinking that you know what yo are doing, just to have something break - and it's usually a missing letter. Thanks JavaScript, enjoy you're coffee, or tea, or whatever you think you are drinking. It was really nice working with Shannon, because she could see what I was doing- and didn't have me try to rephrase everything- just a little syntax correction, like missing periods in the object (re)construction. I should know by now.
The form was really interesting- just pushing objects- and getting the ids - and event listeners to work. Shannon is really good at testing- I wish that I had known how to test last week.  So I am just a half a week behind right now , and I am finished reinventing the wheel - the libraries online are extensive if you know how to phrase the question. And that is the trick to accessing the information.
Good night>>>
