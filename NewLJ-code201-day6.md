Today I am still going to write a new journal because I worked on the .js portion of the cookie store project.
It was broken down into pieces for what the object properties were and the values. then
the object had functions - because the real object was the lists that should show up on the sales html page.
I am really tired, and the peeps that are here are really awesome. I have to leave. There is so much good advice.
Goodnight.
