#LJ-201code-day13
Today I learned about the storage on a browser, and how you can use it to retrieve data that can be used again in the application, or program. It was really fascinating to know the alternative for 'cookies', and it makes retrieving your stored data and information accessible. I was really surprised at the depth of info given back.

Today's code review was really good. As a class, we essentially went through the project step by step, and it was dictated by the peeps in 201- and it was very interesting to see the different ways that people approach the puzzle. I have a tendency to  overthink things- and the for loops can be daunting with the creation of id elements and attaching them to the html. It was really nice to see the layout- although some of the steps were kind of unnecessary- but everyone was doing it the way that worked for them.

I had some great help from one of the Tas who was kind of like me... lets cut to the chase and build everything at once. That doesn't always work out, because in reworking my code I realized that I was missing some vital information that was necessary for the project to meet the objectives- so now I  am here in my jammies, putting my code back together- with the help from my friends in 201...

I should just learn how to do things simpler so they work.
