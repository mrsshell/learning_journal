This is day 3, but it is really groundhog day... because I am doing this over in markdown text.
HA! Told you Nick that I could be unstoppable!

These were my thoughts at 9:00 pm on Wednesday evening after my code broke.

"This is a very long day. I am still challenged with getting the tools to work. I am so very grateful for the attitude of this class. The folks are truly amazing and very committed to their studies.

I am still struggling to get the best view of what I am doing, but in time I will figure it out.
  It is going on 9:00 pm and I am going home to get some sleep.
  Good bye and Good Night!"
