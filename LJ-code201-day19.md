Today I really learned that the input field of the form is the most stubborn element on the page. I spent so much time trying to work around the distance between the field and the button. Dang that is a stubborn piece. The only way I might be able to get it anywhere is to put the thing in a box- which I will try tomorrow morning.

 Had more practice moving things from my downloads into the project files. Unzipping folders and extracting the pieces that I need. The terminal is pretty cool that way.

 Also am getting really good with the Git shit. Of course once I say that, just watch it break. I feel very satisfied with the work I have done. It's invigorating.
