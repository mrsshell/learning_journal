<h3> It Takes a Village</h3>

<p> This was so easy to fugure out at home when I was just writing everything in notepad ++ </P>

<p> So the journey continues thanks to the help from my friends here at the table.</P>

<p> One day I will own this process, because it is just a process- and with continued practice this will become second nature</P>

<p> Man was not born walking.</P>

<h3>Thank God for Tomorrows!</h3>
