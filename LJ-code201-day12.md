#lj-code201-day12.md
Today was kind of a landslide, and then a slow climb back up the hill.
The morning started out trying to rework a broken code that made no sense to me whatsoever.
The code review made me realize that my approach was not correct. So I am still strategizing. I need to turn this around and have it facing the right direction. I am hoping that there is another code review.
I should probably try to keep everything simpler and just make the thing work.

Nick spent an inordinate amount of time with me- and I was really nervous, because I had had a face plant. I really need to understand what I am doing and need to own this so I can do it over and over again. Building things in JavaScript and having them apply to html is pivotal. Nick showed me what my code was creating in html- and I get it.

I was having difficulty understanding the properties of an object and using them later in functions
Properties of an object when you are referencing them, start with a period because they are pointing to that piece of information about the object.  

I will need to really understand this because I plan on building a shiz-load of instances of objects in my lifetime.
