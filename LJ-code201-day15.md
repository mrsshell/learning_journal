Today I worked with Shannon to finish up the bus-order form for the most recent assignment. I downloaded an image and then couldn't find it on my computer files using windows- which hid my bus mall project somewhere. thanks windows. She showed me how  to use my terminal and command line to move image files into another folder-  everything shows up under my downloads, I then move it up into the main line, and then move it folder by folder to the place where I'm working. believe it or not it was less tedious just to go into the terminal to move - than it was to mess around searching my computer. So I get it. This is a better way to access what is on my computer.

We also practiced some fubar activities and now know how to merge screwed up files.
