Today I was progressing with the table on the salmon cookie project, and  kind of hit a turn back.
my numbers were not populating and it was not a product of math, but rather a product of the way I built my table.
I was really struggling with how the JavaScript pieces were to be attached in position on the html page. I really needed to be clear on how to phrase what I needed done.
Nick really helped me just talk through what needed to be done and then broke everything down into the step one step two process. I guess I'm a bit like a computer myself. If you don't tell me what to do and where it goes- I am lost.
once I know this process it will be easier to break down the next thing into a process.
I am creating a recipe to make events appear on the page. I am going to be working more on the code tonight, because I am sure  that I had a breakthrough.
