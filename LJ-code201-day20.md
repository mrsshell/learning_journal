#LJ-code201-day20
Today was the final presentation for the project. I think that it went well... last night before I went to bed, I realized that the presentation needed structure, and it needed to be explained in layman's terms before we dove into any technical verbiage. I spent some time hitting the why, and what we were trying to do. I had to write it out on cards so that I wouldn't be lost for words. I tried to make the presentation an ask- kind of like a wonder ... to get the curiosity going. I hope it wasn't too hokey- kind of took the toastmaster approach with the opening joke that is so old your great-grandmother told it when she was young. I thought it went okay, we could have practiced some more- but I think that in the first few runs Nathan was more excited and went into more detail. ( I really like that guy)

I have learned so much from the group. Even on the Seattle Slack channel - people post really interesting things, and I look them up, and before I know I am looking deeper and deeper and an hour is gone. I read the post about the beta testing, and just had to see for myself. The more I learn about prototypes, the more excited I am to go there. I am going to finish up the projects and then get going on some self study. I need to be up to speed on the next level classes.
