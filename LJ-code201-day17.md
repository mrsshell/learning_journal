Today I got to do the local storage on the js page- and have the hands on experience on how to phrase the js.
I have been messing around with this on the other project- and now will apply it on the bus-mall after project week is complete.
I found out the way to connect multiple css sheets to a page- nice... I am also very glad that I have this team to work with.
