Hai Hai (that is hi in Norwegian)
First of all, I apologize for not using the markdown correctly. Cody just sent me the instructions in slack.

Today was totally AMAZING!!! I am so glad that I pent long hors last night getting my code to work!
(Yes it totally broke between 6:30 and 7:00 last night) I had to rewrite the array and for-loop because the page would not open in a browser. Of course it was some silly symbol that was left over down below my line of sight- so I couldn't even use the inspect to view the error. I finally fixed it by holding the delete button down for about a minute before writing everything again. Then did a happy dance and went home.

Last night there were a few peeps from the 401 JavaScript class that were helping us fix our broken for-loops. They were so helpful.
I want to be there one day when I can help like that. OMG they looked like they were getting lots out of it, even tough they probably had so much work to do. I love this coding community.

Matt is awesome to work with- and TG everything worked.

I am going to work on some plans tonight to separate the elements in the CSS page and have a plan for how I want to move things around.
