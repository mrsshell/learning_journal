# LJ-code201-day5.md
Today is Friday and I started off the day replacing all of the week's learning journals. Because I can.

Today we had lots of teamwork doing the math functions - I thought that I had created new branches, however they were branches of branches- not cool. This is still going to be something that will be really important to understand.

I liked going through the opening examination of fellow coder's code. I learn something new every time.
My handwriting has been so atrocious that I can't read it later , and it makes no sense. So I am taking notes- and I process the information better.

I am going to state the steps as I understand them.
from about me- create a branch to finish my work.
finish, git push to origin branch name.
create a pull request to merge.
from my pc git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages
find url in settings
submit url from web and url from my repo in canvas.

Wish me luck and if this works i will slack this to my peeps.
