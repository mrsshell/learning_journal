I have had the super best experience ever learning how to fix my code!!! The console logs are vital to show if the code is running true or false in the loops and where the code is broken. it's great because you can go in step by step and try to work out the logic of only the broken piece. Writing this page also made me realize that if I ever need a text editor for spelling on a page, I can go in and create this , and then copy paste copy to the paragraph portion of the page. (yes I know, simple,  and it will be totally accessible while I'm working.)

So Today Brian met me at a local coffee shop to help set up my computer for a dual boot with Ubuntu. I had a piece of code in one of my questions that was giving my a false true. It was the array for loop- returned that my favorite color was pickles- which is incredibly funny when you are working on five hours of sleep- and your daughter sends you a photo of the pickles that she just made- and your reply is, "That's one of y favorite colors!!!"

So the if was removed from the if/else because it was going to be true of false and that's it. Then I also realized that I passed [i] into the argument which was only the counter, and had nothing to do with the array. Then used the .includes() method to have the user's response activate the true or false response. I had a variable that used the .length declaration in the condition to have the loop run only for the number of items in the array. Most important- had to reassign the variable with a different prompt -because the user response still needed to be stored to continue the loop. To make it run correctly, it was placed inside the if and else decision branch- to allow the user to guess again if the program ran either false - or true... for the length of the array. This practice of breaking down the steps that are in motion is like AMAZING... okay so I'm really jazzed. I like .js

Had a very exhilarating time merging the branch I was working on with the partner program...  because I did not know to pull the master back into my computer- there was a conflict- to resolve this the conflicts shoed up in the log with which branch they were from-  In this case it was the master and the branch I worked on this weekend. So had to go through and delete the bad code from the log which , I can see how you have to be super careful, because if one person deletes the wrong code...it's gone. After the conflict was over, and the merge was successful then the new merge became the master.

Then I made sure that my master was up to date- opened it back up and made changes to the read-me section. Then I added and committed the changes and opened up a new gh-pages branch from the updated master. I pushed it to origin gh-pages and then went back to the setting in my repo to find the page and web address. Cool beans. Really learned that the git pull origin master will bring the new updated master back in my computer. This is really going to help me in the future for sure.

that is great!!
