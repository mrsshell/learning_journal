#LJ-code201-day16
Today was the first day of our group project and we had a very organized time- It seemed that everyone was working in synch and the project is going smoothly. We started out with a very clear idea of what we were going to accomplish with the read file. I spent a bit of time this morning gathering assets so we would have things in place when we needed them. Nathan also did some work, and just copied some of the script from his local file onto his branch of the project. We always made sure that we were always working on different sheets. I am really glad to have this group- they are very supportive.
